Note for Instructors This tutorial is intended for GIS users with an established cursory understanding of how to use GIS software for visualizing spatial data and making maps, regardless of whether they are graduate, undergraduate, or faculty/staff users. These users may have encountered web services for GIS in formats like WMS, WMTS, or WFS, but are unsure of how to use them. This tutorial is meant to introduce users to these formats, demonstrate how to find them in the BTAA Geoportal, and show how to use them in QGIS, ArcGIS Desktop, ArcGIS Online, and ArcGIS Pro. For an extra challenge involving the use of ArcGIS Feature Services to create a web map with Leaflet , please follow the link to my tutorial on GitHub . These slides walk through the steps of loading an ArcGIS Feature Service in several of the most commonly used GIS platforms. Please use the links provided on the Loading Web Services: Menu page to jump to the appropriate slides for your preferred software. The tutorial was designed for in-person, hybrid, and online instructional contexts. The self-guided review activity can be assigned to be completed after class, or as a live activity where students can pose questions to the instructor and other students, in person or through a chat window, as they work through it. Learning Objectives Through completing this tutorial, students will: Learn the basics of GIS web services - What are they? What kind of data do they host? What are the benefits and drawbacks? Locate and load an ArcGIS Feature Service with the BTAA Geoportal and their preferred GIS software. Find and load their own web service through the BTAA Geoportal and consider the utility of their data to different kinds of users. Intro to Web Services Several types of web services available to GIS users that serve geospatial data in different formats from web servers. As documented in the tutorial, Types of Geospatial Information by Nicole Kong, geospatial data for web services fall into four categories: vector, raster, tabular, and scanned maps. For this exercise, we will focus on the categories below: Data Type What is it? Relevant Web Service Vector Discrete points, lines, or polygons WFS/ArcGIS Feature Service Raster Continuous pixelated data with each pixel assigned a value WMS/ArcGIS Map Service Scanned Map A scanned sheet map in image format WMTS/ArcGIS Tiled Map Service Effective use of all these services will likely save you a lot of time downloading, cleaning, processing, and managing your data. Web Feature Service (WFS) Features: Direct access to vector data curated by the organization hosting the data. You will not need to join tabular data from one source to shapefiles from another source, and you will often have a direct connection to consistently updated data. Drawbacks: Updates to the tables are dependent upon the host. What happens if the server goes down or the data cease to be updated? For regularly updated data, it can be difficult to determine all possible values for classification purposes, if only a portion are used frequently, and the metadata are not very detailed. Web Map Service (WMS) Features: Renders geospatial data as map images. Similar benefits to WFS. Drawbacks: Can be quite limiting if derived from data that were originally in vector format \u2013 loss of associated tabular data. Web Map Tile Service (WMTS) Features: Access to scanned maps that are already georeferenced. Saves a lot of time considering how painstakingly slow georeferencing can be! Drawbacks: The georeferencing is not always great. You may find yourself redoing it anyway. Question Can you think of any drawbacks or reasons why it might be preferable to download, process, and manage your own data? For additional information about these services, navigate to the glossary page . Locating Services For the purposes of this exercise, let\u2019s map leaking underground storage tanks in Iowa. Navigate to the BTAA Geoportal . Search for \u201cIowa leaking tanks.\u201d In the results, under \u201cLimit your search,\u201d scroll down to \u201cResource Class\u201d and click \u201cWeb Services.\u201d This will limit your results to web services (not needed here, but it will help if you have many search results). Click the result entitled \u201cLeaking Underground Storage Tanks: Iowa,\u201d hosted by the Iowa DNR. In the upper right corner, under \u201cLinks,\u201d click \u201cWeb Services.\u201d Now you have access to a web service URL! Tip For a more thorough exploration of using the BTAA Geoportal, please see the tutorial entitled Finding Geospatial Data by Joshua Sadvari. Loading Web Services There are slightly different steps for loading web services depending upon which GIS platform you are using. QGIS Now that you have access to a web service, you will want to know how to use it in your preferred GIS software. For this exercise, we will use QGIS. Open QGIS and go to the Layer drop down menu. Click Add Layer > Add ArcGIS FeatureServer Layer. Add an ArcGIS FeatureServer Layer in QGIS In the window that opens, click \u201cNew\u201d to establish a new connection between QGIS and the web service. New server connection in QGIS Give your connection a meaningful name, like \u201cIowa Environment Data\u201d Paste the URL obtained from the geoportal into the empty box next to \u201cURL\u201d and click \u201cOK.\u201d Name and enter your service URL Warning Make sure that you cut off everything in the address after \u201cMapServer,\u201d ex: https://programs.iowadnr.gov/geospatial/rest/services/OneStop/QueryEnvFacs/MapServer The Server Connection window will appear. Highlight \u201cLeaking Underground Storage Tanks\u201d and click \u201cAdd\u201d at the bottom of the window. QGIS Server Connection Window \u201cLeaking Underground Storage Tanks\u201d will appear in your Table of Contents. If you have not added a base map, do so now. As you can see, the map window is crowded with many symbols, but you now have data from a web service in your map window! Iowa Leaking Underground Storage Tanks web service Look at the attribute table and play around with editing the symbology based on one of the fields. There is a lot of interesting info! Iowa Leaking Underground Storage Tanks web service with layer styling ArcGIS Pro Now that you have access to a web service, you will want to know how to use it in your preferred GIS software. For this exercise, we will use ArcGIS Pro. Open ArcGIS Pro, go to the Insert tab, and click \u201cConnections.\u201d In these options, you will also notice options for other types of web services. You can experiment with adding these later. Click \u201cNew ArcGIS Server.\u201d Paste the URL obtained from the geoportal into the empty box next to Server URL and click \u201cOK.\u201d In the Catalog window, open \u201cProject,\u201d expand \u201cServers,\u201d and expand the service you just connected. Notice that you are connected to all the services the Iowa DNR offers. Expand \u201cOneStop\u201d and \u201cQueryEnvFacs.\u201d Use \u201cLeaking Underground Storage Tanks\u201d and select \u201cAdd To Current Map.\u201d You may need to zoom into your map in order to see the data, as it is scale-dependent upon loading in Pro. You will also notice that the map window is crowded with many symbols, but you now have data from a web service in your map window! Look at the attribute table and play around with editing the symbology based on one of the fields. There is a lot of interesting info! ArcGIS Online Now that you have access to a web service, you will want to know how to use it in your preferred GIS software. For this exercise, we will use ArcGIS Online. Make sure to select \u201cAn ArcGIS Server Web Service\u201d for this data. You will also notice options for other types of web services. You can experiment with adding these later. Open ArcGIS Online, go to the Add tab, and click \u201cAdd Layer from Web.\u201d Copy and paste the web service URL in the empty box next to \u201cURL\u201d and click \u201cAdd Layer.\u201d ArcGIS Online will automatically add the data to your map window. You will notice that there is a high density of similar symbols, but you now have data from a web service in your map window! Look at the attribute table and play around with editing the symbology based on one of the fields. There is a lot of interesting info! ArcGIS Desktop Now that you have access to a web service, you will want to know how to use it in your preferred GIS software. For this exercise, we will use ArcGIS Desktop. Open ArcGIS Pro, open the Catalog window, maximize \u201cGIS Servers,\u201d click \u201cAdd ArcGIS Server.\u201d Paste the web service URL into the box next to \u201cServer URL\u201d and click \u201cFinish.\u201d Choose \u201cUse GIS Services\u201d and click \u201cNext.\u201d In the Catalog window, expand the service you just connected.
